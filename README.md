## Financial Calculations

### Daily Limit Calculation
When using percentage-based savings:
1. Total available amount = Income - (Income ร Savings %)
2. Daily limit = Available amount รท Days until next payday

When using fixed daily limit:
- The daily limit is simply the amount you specified

### Rollover/Deficit Logic
- **If you spend less than your daily limit**: The unspent amount is added to the next day's limit
  - Example: If your limit is $26 and you spend $20, the next day's limit will be $26 + $6 = $32

- **If you spend more than your daily limit**: The excess is subtracted from the next day's limit
  - Example: If your limit is $26 and you spend $30, the next day's limit will be $26 - ($30 - $26) = $22

## Tips and Best Practices

### Setting Effective Savings Goals
- Start with a modest savings percentage (10-15%) and adjust as needed
- Consider your fixed expenses when setting daily limits
- Adjust your savings goals for months with unusual expenses

### Daily Financial Management
- Enter expenses as they occur to maintain accurate daily limits
- Review your spending patterns at the end of each week
- Adjust your savings goals or daily limits based on your financial progress

### Long-term Planning
- Use the application to experiment with different savings percentages
- Track how changes in income affect your daily spending capacity
- Identify spending patterns to optimize your financial habits
